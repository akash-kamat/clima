# 🌤️ Cli-ma

Hey there 👋  
This is my **first time trying out Rust** — I wanted to test it by building something practical and fun.  
Rust turned out to be really nice for making CLI tools 🚀, so I ended up creating **Cli-ma**, a small weather app that looks good and runs fast.  

It fetches real-time weather data from [wttr.in](https://wttr.in/) and displays it with colors, emojis, and a neat little spinner animation ✨.  
Think of it as a mix of **useful + pretty + geeky vibes** 😎.

- ⚡ Fast, lightweight, single-binary app  
- 🦀 My little experiment to learn Rust, polished into a tool
